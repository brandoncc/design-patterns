## Observer Pattern

According to
[Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do),
the Observer Pattern is defined as:

> Observer - defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one
> object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
> automatically.

A common use of the observer pattern is the ability to attach event listeners to
DOM events in browsers.
